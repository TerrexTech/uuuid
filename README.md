## Universal Universally Unique ID
---

A UUID package that implements/will-implement required Marshalling/Unmarshalling interfaces for various types.

**Based on [github.com/gofrs/uuid][0]**.

### Why?

It has been a source of great pain and inconvenience for my lazy existence, that the UUIDs have to be
converted again and again to different types for operations such as inserting/fetching from Databases.

Enough. Not any more.

### Currently implemented Marshal/Unmarshal interfaces
